# wimm
This is a long term puppy project. It was created to help me to find out where my money were spent.
It was initially created at code.google.com/p/wimm and automatically migrated into GitHub.
Project is still alive (November 3, 2018) and will be extended.
If you think it needs new features - please let me know.

Best regards,
              Alexey Shtykov.
